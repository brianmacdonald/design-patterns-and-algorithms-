# Design Patterns and Algorithms

## Creational patterns
 - *Abstract factory pattern*: groups object factories that have a common theme.
 - *Builder pattern*: constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
 - *Factory method pattern*: creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
 - *Prototype pattern*: creates objects by cloning an existing object.
 - *Singleton pattern*: restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
